**Null Object Design Pattern**

The Null Object is a design pattern where "nothing will come of nothing".

**Use Case When**

1. An object requires a collaborator. The Null Object pattern does not introduce this collaboration--it makes use of a collaboration that already exists
2. Some collaborator instances should do nothing
3. You want to abstract the handling of null away from the client
