**Decorator Design Pattern**

The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality


**Design Principle**

1. The Decorator Pattern provides an alternative to subclassing for extending behavior.
2. The Decorator Pattern involves a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.
3. Decorator classes mirror the type of the components they decorate. 
4. Decorators change the behavior of their components by adding new functionality before and/or after (or even in place of) method calls to the component.
5. Decorators can result in many small objects in our design, and overuse can be complex
