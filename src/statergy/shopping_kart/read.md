**Strategy Design Pattern**

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

**Design Principle**

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
   
3. Favor composition over inheritance. It let you encapsulate a family of algorithms into their own set of classes, but it also lets you change behavior at runtime as long as the object youâ€™re composing with implements the correct behavior interface.
